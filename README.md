# Exploring-US-Births-1993---2003-
A Jupyter Notebook project exploring the total number of births on different days, months, years etc. using a Kaggle Dataset

The project uses simple manipulations on the dataset to make it more readable. It can be used as an example and be used to calaculate and analyse data on other datasets of your own project.

Here's the link to the dataset [Kaggle Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sukku04/usbirth19942003)
## Steps->
1) The data was made into a list of lists so that it could easily be read and manipulated.
2) The headers were removed so that they don't interfere when we use "for" loops to add all the 
  numbers.
3) Lastly, all the data sorted into births per year, months, days of month and days of week is printed.

4) The project could be expanded by adding additional features such as writing a dictionary function to find its
  min and max values.
